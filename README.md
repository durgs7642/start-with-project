# 🏠 Airbnb Clone – Full Stack Web Application

A full-stack **Airbnb Clone** built to replicate the core functionality of a real accommodation booking platform.  
While this project does not include every feature of Airbnb, it successfully implements **all major and essential features** required for a real-world listing and discovery system.

The project focuses on **authentication, listings, geolocation, reviews, filters, and image uploads**, giving a strong understanding of how marketplace platforms are built.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Airbnb Clone allows users to create and explore property listings with location-based search, reviews, and ratings.  
Users can securely register, log in, add new listings, upload images, and interact with other listings through reviews.

The main goal of this project was to understand **end-to-end application flow**, backend validations, session-based authentication, and real-world data handling.
